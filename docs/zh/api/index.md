## animate

#### Summary
Animate properties of the actors with the specified IDs via key frames.  Key frames for the animated parameters are delimited with `|` literals.

#### Remarks
Be aware, that this command searches for actors with the provided IDs over all the actor managers,  and in case multiple actors with the same ID exist (eg, a character and a text printer), this will affect only the first found one.  <br /><br />  When running the animate commands in parallel (`wait` is set to false) the affected actors state can mutate unpredictably.  This could cause unexpected results when rolling back or performing other commands that affect state of the actor. Make sure to reset  affected properties of the animated actors (position, tint, appearance, etc) after the command finishes or use `@animate CharacterId`  (without any args) to stop the animation prematurely.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description

; changing positions: first step will take 1, second — 0.5 and third — 3 seconds.
@animate Kohaku posX:50|0|85 time:1|0.5|3

; Start loop animations of `Yuko` and `Kohaku` actors; notice, that you can skip
; key values indicating that the parameter shouldn't change during the animation step.

## back

#### Summary
Modifies a [background actor](/zh/guide/backgrounds).

#### Remarks
Backgrounds are handled a bit differently from characters to better accommodate traditional VN game flow.  Most of the time you'll probably have a single background actor on scene, which will constantly transition to different appearances.  To remove the hassle of repeating same actor ID in scripts, it's possible to provide only  the background appearance and transition type (optional) as a nameless parameter assuming `MainBackground`  actor should be affected. When this is not the case, ID of the background actor can be explicitly provided via the `id` parameter.

## gosub

#### Summary
Navigates naninovel script playback to the provided path and saves that path to global state;  [@return] commands use this info to redirect to command after the last invoked gosub command.  Designed to serve as a function (subroutine) in a programming language, allowing to reuse a piece of naninovel script.  Useful for invoking a repeating set of commands multiple times.

#### Remarks
It's possible to declare a gosub outside of the currently played script and use it from any other scripts;  by default state reset won't happen when you're loading another script to play a gosub or returning back to  prevent delays and loading screens. Be aware though, that all the resources referenced in gosub script will be  held until the next state reset.

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="command-param-nameless command-param-required" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the command identifer without specifying parameter ID  Required parameter: parameter should always be specified">Path</span> | Named&lt;String&gt; | Path to navigate into in the following format: `ScriptName.LabelName`.  When label name is ommited, will play provided script from the start.  When script name is ommited, will attempt to find a label in the currently played script.
reset | List&lt;String&gt; | When specified, will reset the engine services state before loading a script (in case the path is leading to another script).  Specify `*` to reset all the services, or specify service names to exclude from reset.  By default, the state does not reset.

</div>

#### Example
```
; Navigate the playback to the label `VictoryScene` in the currently played script,
; executes the commands and navigates back to the command after the `gosub`.
@gosub .VictoryScene
...
@stop

# VictoryScene
@back Victory
@sfx Fireworks
@bgm Fanfares
You are victorious!
@return

; Another example with some branching inside the subroutine.
@set time=10
; Here we get one result
@gosub .Room
...
@set time=3
; And here we get another
@gosub .Room
...

# Room
@print "It's too early, I should visit this place when it's dark." if:time<21&&time>6
@print "I can sense an ominous presence here!" if:time>21&&time<6
@return
```

## goto

#### Summary
Navigates naninovel script playback to the provided path.  When the path leads to another (not the currently played) naninovel script, will also [reset state](/zh/api/#resetstate)  before loading the target script, unless [ResetStateOnLoad](https://naninovel.com/guide/configuration.html#state) is disabled in the configuration.

When label name is ommited, will play provided script from the start.  When script name is ommited, will attempt to find a label in the currently played script.
reset | List&lt;String&gt; | When specified, will control whether to reset the engine services state before loading a script (in case the path is leading to another script):<br />  - Specify `*` to reset all the services, except the ones with `DontResetAttribute`.<br />  - Specify service type names (separated by comma) to exclude from reset; all the other services will be reset, including the ones with `DontResetAttribute`.<br />  - Specify `-` to force no reset (even if it's enabled by default in the configuration).

</div>

#### Example
```
; Loads and starts playing a naninovel script with the name `Script001` from the start.
@goto Script001

; Save as above, but start playing from the label `AfterStorm`.
@goto Script001.AfterStorm

; Navigates the playback to the label `Epilogue` in the currently played script.
@goto .Epilogue

; Load Script001, but don't reset audio manager (any playing audio won't be interrupted).

#### Remarks
The process is asynchronous and is masked with a loading screen ([ILoadingUI](https://naninovel.com/guide/user-interface.html#ui-customization)).  <br /><br />  When [ResetStateOnLoad](https://naninovel.com/guide/configuration.html#state) is disabled in the configuration, you can use this command  to manually dispose unused resources to prevent memory leak issues.  <br /><br />  Be aware, that this command can not be undone (rewinded back).

#### Parameters

## save

#### Summary
Automatically save the game to a quick save slot.

#### Example
```
@save
```

## set

#### Summary
Assigns result of a [script expression](/zh/guide/script-expressions) to a [custom variable](/zh/guide/custom-variables).

#### Remarks
Variable name should be alphanumeric (latin characters only) and can contain underscores, eg: `name`, `Char1Score`, `my_score`;  the names are case-insensitive, eg: `myscore` is equal to `MyScore`. If a variable with the provided name doesn't exist, it will be automatically created.  <br /><br />  It's possible to define multiple set expressions in one line by separating them with `;`. The expressions will be executed in sequence by the order of declaratation.  <br /><br />  Custom variables are stored in **local scope** by default. This means, that if you assign some variable in the course of gameplay  and player starts a new game or loads another saved game slot, where that variable wasn't assigned — the value will be lost.  If you wish to store the variable in **global scope** instead, prepend `G_` or `g_` to its name, eg: `G_FinishedMainRoute` or `g_total_score`.  <br /><br />  In case variable name starts with `T_` or `t_` it's considered a reference to a value stored in 'Script' [managed text](/zh/guide/managed-text) document.  Such variables can't be assiged and mostly used for referencing localizable text values.  <br /><br />  You can get and set custom variables in C# scripts via `CustomVariableManager` [engine service](/zh/guide/engine-services).

#### Parameters

<div class="config-table">

ID | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
<span class="command-param-nameless command-param-required" title="Nameless parameter: value should be provided after the command identifer without specifying parameter ID  Required parameter: parameter should always be specified">Expression</span> | String | Set expression.  <br /><br />  The expression should be in the following format: `VariableName=ExpressionBody`, where `VariableName` is the name of the custom  variable to assign and `ExpressionBody` is a [script expression](/zh/guide/script-expressions), the result of which should be assigned to the variable.  <br /><br />  It's also possible to use increment and decrement unary operators, eg: `@set foo++`, `@set foo--`.

</div>

#### Example
```
; Assign `foo` variable a `bar` string value
@set foo="bar"

; Assign `foo` variable a 1 number value
@set foo=1

; Assign `foo` variable a `true` boolean value
@set foo=true

; If `foo` is a number, add 0.5 to its value
@set foo=foo+0.5

; If `angle` is a number, assign its cosine to `result` variable
@set result=Cos(angle)

; Get a random integer between -100 and 100, then raise to power of 4 and assign to `result` variable
@set "result = Pow(Random(-100, 100), 4)"

; If `foo` is a number, add 1 to its value
@set foo++

; If `foo` is a number, subtract 1 from its value
@set foo--

; Assign `foo` variable value of the `bar` variable, which is `Hello World!`.
; Notice, that `bar` variable should actually exist, otherwise `bar` plain text value will be assigned instead.
@set bar="Hello World!"
